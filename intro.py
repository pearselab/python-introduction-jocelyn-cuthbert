###1### Write loop that prints out the numbers from 20 to 10
for i in range (10,20,1):
    print (i)
#Gave me nothing yet.....I think that because I am starting at 20, and adding positive one
    for i in range (10,20,-1):
    print (i)
#This worked correctly!  Yay!
    
###2### Write a list comprehension that returns the numbers form 20 to 10
results = []
for each in range (5, 10, 1):
    result append(each*2)
quicker_result = [each *2 for each in range(5,10)]

results = []
for each in range (20, 10, -1):
    print (result)
    

###3### Write a loop that prints out only the numbers from 20 to 10 that are even.
for i in range(20, 10, -2):
    print(i)
#This works but doesn't give me ten.  So I think that I need to go smaller than ten....
for i in range(20, 9, -2):
    print(i)
#Bam.  Even numbers.

#4. Write a list comprehension that prints out only the numbers from 20 to 10 that are even

#5. Write a function that calculates whether a number is a prime number
